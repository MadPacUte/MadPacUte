### Hi! 👋

<!--
**MadPacUte/MadPacUte** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Randall (he/him/his) and I enjoy working in R (RStudio as my IDE of choice).   

Most of the analytical work that I do is not made public. However, when I find something of interest, I try to post it within my GitHub profile. In my spare time I enjoy running. 

I created a website for my fantasy football league that I joined in 2020 (won fourth place). I have a few side projects that I want to accomplish in the near future. Feel free to reach out to me! 

You can find me on Twitter https://twitter.com/MadPacUte and my personal website https://sites.google.com/view/randanalytics/home.
